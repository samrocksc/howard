# CONTRIBUTING & CODE OF CONDUCT

### Code of Conduct
The Code of Conduct is simple, don't be an ass to people.  Be nice, and respect learning curves regardless of who is working with this code base.  If you use it, make something cool with it, and always be friendly to everyone.

### Contributing
Make your PR's as short and simple as possible please, hanging commas please.  Test it, make sure code coverage is maintained at 100% before passing PR in.  All PR's must be submitted with a horrible joke.
